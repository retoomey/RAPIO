Realtime Algorithm and Parameter I/O
RAPIO Python Interface and helper algorithms
Created by Robert Toomey as part of RAPIO

Note:
  RAPIOPY is the python library you need to copy into your python site packages.
  This provides the interface for interacting with the C++ part of RAPIO.
  The C++ part of RAPIO maintains all I/O and notification, typically you
  deal with JSON and numpy arrays within your Python code.
