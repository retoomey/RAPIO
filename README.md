# RAPIO

Real-time Algorithm Parameter and IO

RAPIO is a data input and output system in C++ (Linux) designed for making it as simple as possible to quickly implement a real-time algorithm.  A real-time algorithm is something expecting data at regular intervals from some source(s), after which it processes this data in some way and then outputs more data, some optionally. The focus of RAPIO is on automating and hiding the back core of reading, writing, notification and parameters for these algorithms.  We also implement and keep consistent common parameters that are shared among any algorithm.

At the [National Severe Storms Laboratory](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov) we collect big data from hundreds of radars and process this data with proprietary meteorology algorithms.  Our algorithm collection comes from various systems, such as the [Warning Decision Support System --Integrated Information](http://www.wdssii.org), as well as other groups within the lab.  These systems run important algorithms such as tornado prediction, clustering, and weighted merging of data. 

* Parameters for algorithms
* Input of data with filters
* Output of data with filters
* Data monitoring (Linux FAM, IO polling, Web polling, etc.) 
* Data notification (.fml MRMS/WDSSII files, AWS, etc. )
* Built in support for [MRMS/WDSSII data sets and indexes](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/mrms/)

## Current devel rpm requirements (probably more, we have a lot of RPMS installed in Centos/Redhat)
* udunits-2.2.24 (Unit conversion)
* curl 7.55  (Web ingest)
* netcdf-c-4.6.1 and hdf5  (Reading MRMS/WDSSII data formats)
* proj-4.9.3 (Data projection) --Actually not 'yet' but I've got code that will use it
* bzip2
* Most algorithms link with -lrapio -lcurl -lnetcdf -ludunits2 -lbz2
* uncrustify (For formatting code if you are contributing to core code)

## Main differences to using parts of WDSSII for data
* No SmartPtr classes.  You have to use c++11 shared_ptr, unique_ptr and STL
* Differences in the archive vs. real-time modes of WDSSII to be more flexible.

## API Documentation
* I might put a Travis CI autogenerated doxygen on github eventually, but at the moment you can generate locally by running "doxygen rapio.dox" in the project directory.
* The rexample folder is meant as a general API example and will be updated as RAPIO is.  The rexample shows a simple algorithm that echos its input to output. Obviously in a real life situation you would do something to the data first and output different stuff, either modifying in place or creating a clone.

## Current Status/Features
* Currently I'm speed testing the beta, gaining 30% CPU speed and 25% reduction in memory usage when used as back system for a WDSSII algorithm.
* Adding abilities, improving speed, fixing bugs.
* Currently designed to be built as a 3rd party library within an MRMS/WDSSII build, but could be built standalone if all requirements met.
