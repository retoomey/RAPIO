     format: one of
       netcdf - The WDSS-II netcdf4Classic format (supported types: all products except DataTable)
       netcdf3 - The WDSS-II netcdf3 legacy format (supported types: all products except DataTable)
       xml    - The WDSS-II XML format (supported types: DataTable
       awips  - The AWIPS netcdf format (supported types: LatLonGrid)
     compression : Turn on or off gzip compression (default=true)
     compressionlevel : Level setting for gzip (default=6)
     subdirs     : Turn on or off writing into sub-directories (default=true)
     sparsegrid  : Specify when to use run-length encoding: never/always/xxx where xxx is the expected saving in storage space realized. ****This is used only by the netcdf3 encoder.****
     cdmcompliance:  Normally, the netcdf encoder does not write the latitude/longitude of the grid points.  Turning this option on will make it write those out. This option also implies sparsegrid=never
     faacompliance:  Normally, the netcdf encoder does not write the latitude/longitude of the grid points.  Turning this option on will make it write those out. This option also implies sparsegrid=never.  Implies CDM compliance and will also contains whatever tweaks the FAA requires for it's readers.
