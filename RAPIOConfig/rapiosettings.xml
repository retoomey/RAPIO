<!-- RAPIO global settings file

  The whole global vs command line debate...things will evolve hopefully

<settings>

<!-- Settings for the individual datatype reader/writers. 
     Currently these are global for every algorithm
Information needed:
1.  names  == the introduced builder name.  Used in FML records, etc. It's the
    lookup for a record to a reader. Spaces separate alias
2.  Each io can have multiple outputs with different settings, allowing a 
    writer to be called multiple times.  For example writing png and jpeg at 
    same time.

<!-- ncflags: Combined cmode flags for nc_create function. 
              Example: 4096 == 0x1000 == NC_NETCDF4
                       256  == 0x0100 == NC_CLASSIC_MODEL   (This is fast)
              We 'could' use strings but that would limit ability here.
              Note: Mess up this value and it will complain on writing.
