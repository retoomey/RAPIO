  The whole global vs command line debate...things will evolve hopefully

<settings>

<!-- Settings for logging output, colors, etc. Note: These settings
     are read once on algorithm startup. Note logging verbosity is
     always set on command line
     use:   The logging engine.  Most likely I'm going to want to log to AWS
            or something at some point directly, so we have a choice of how to
            log.  Currently there are two:
            "cout"  Use std::cout direct printing. (works with more better)
            "boost" Use boost logging.
     flush: milliseconds between hard flushes of log.  The smaller this
            number the slower things will be
     color: Set to 'true' to show colors in logging.  Colors can be
            nice but many capture utilities, etc. can freak out so
            this allows turning off globally.
     helpcolor: Set to 'true' to show colors in alg help.
     pattern: Logging pattern with following tokens:
             %TIME% Current UTC time
             %TIMEMS% Current UTC time with milliseconds
             %TIMEC% Current clock with milliseconds
             %LEVEL% The logging level of the message such as 'severe'
             %MESSAGE% The raw logging message
             %THREADID% The thread id responsible for printing
        Debugging support:
             %FILE% The file name in code
             %LINE% The line of the file name
             %FUNCTION% Full function name and parameters currently in
        Color support: (I'll probably come back later replace with general RGB)
             %ECOLOR% Mark info green, debug cyan, error red
             %RED% ansi red, iff color true
             %GREEN% ansi red, iff color true
             %BLUE% ansi red, iff color true
             %YELLOW% ansi red, iff color true
             %OFF% turn off current color

        For MRMS w2algrun stuff, I recommand this pattern:
            This is because the logger adds its own timestamp, etc.
            The timec will still add just the clock so you'll know
            difference between log time and output time.
            pattern="%TIMEC%%LEVEL%:%FILE%:%LINE%: %MESSAGE%"
        General developers:
            pattern="%GREEN%[%TIMEMS%]%ECOLOR% %LEVEL%:%YELLOW%%FILE%:%GREEN%%LINE%:%OFF% %MESSAGE%"
        General operations:
            pattern="%GREEN%[%TIMEMS%]%ECOLOR% %LEVEL%:%OFF% %MESSAGE%"

<!-- Settings for the individual datatype reader/writers. 
     Currently these are global for every algorithm
Information needed:
1.  names  == the introduced builder name.  Used in FML records, etc. It's the
    lookup for a record to a reader. Spaces separate alias
2.  Each io can have multiple outputs with different settings, allowing a 
    writer to be called multiple times.  For example writing png and jpeg at 
    same time.

<!-- Netcdf module settings
     ncflags: Combined cmode flags for nc_create function. 
              Example: 4096 == 0x1000 == NC_NETCDF4
                       256  == 0x0100 == NC_CLASSIC_MODEL   (This is fast)
              We 'could' use strings but that would limit ability here.
              Note: Mess up this value and it will complain on writing.
     nc_def_var_deflate parameters
     deflate_level: 0 no compression to 9 max compression

<!-- Python module settings
     bin: Path of python executable.  RAPIO will try to find your python
          from your path, but you can force it here if it's unable or grabbing
          the wrong python.
          Example: <output bin="/usr/bin/python"/>
     print: 'true' Log the print output of the python script

<!-- Imagick module settings
     cols: width of image
     rows: height of image
     suffix: Imagick magic file ending such as png, tif, jpg
             The suffix is how Imagick chooses its file output format 
     FIXME: Add more settings and tile settings and ability
     mode:   "degrees" Degree out from center degrees
                 degrees: The degrees out from center point of data
             "full" Use full extent, row cols of data (For example, full LatLonGrid )

<!-- GDAL module
     cols: width of image
     rows: height of image
     suffix: added to the file ending.
     driver: Known GDAL driver string say from https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html

     degrees: Degrees out from datatype center to create a Lat Lon coverage

<!-- GRIB module
     bmode: Buffer mode.  How to read file and buffer.
              Example: 0: Read file by message (field buffer)
                          Seek/read by grib2 message.
                          RAM is only required for the current grib2 message.
                          This is the default so we're RAM friendly with MRMS
                          and other algorithms.
                       1: Read file entirely into RAM then process
                          This mode 'may' be quicker but you need RAM
                          for the entire file and some grib2 files are
                          fairly large say 1 GB or more.
