<!-- RAPIO global settings file 
   Toomey December 2020

  The whole global vs command line debate...things will evolve hopefully
-->

<settings>

<!-- Settings for the individual datatype reader/writers. 
     Currently these are global for every algorithm
Information needed:
1.  names  == the introduced builder name.  Used in FML records, etc. It's the
    lookup for a record to a reader. Spaces separate alias
2.  Each io can have multiple outputs with different settings, allowing a 
    writer to be called multiple times.  For example writing png and jpeg at 
    same time.
 -->
<datatype subdirs="true">

<!-- Settings for the built in XML reader --> 
  <io names="xml W2ALGS">
    <output />
  </io>

<!-- Netcdf module settings
     ncflags: Combined cmode flags for nc_create function. 
              Example: 4096 == 0x1000 == NC_NETCDF4
                       256  == 0x0100 == NC_CLASSIC_MODEL   (This is fast)
              We 'could' use strings but that would limit ability here.
              Note: Mess up this value and it will complain on writing.
     nc_def_var_deflate parameters
     deflate_level: 0 no compression to 9 max compression
-->
  <io names="netcdf netcdf3" module="librapionetcdf.so">
    <output ncflags="4096" deflate_level="3"/>
  </io>

<!-- Python module settings
     bin: Path of python executable.  RAPIO will try to find your python
          from your path, but you can force it here if it's unable or grabbing
          the wrong python.
          Example: <output bin="/usr/bin/python"/>
     print: 'true' Log the print output of the python script
-->
  <io names="python" module="librapiopython.so">
    <output print="true"/>
  </io>

<!-- Imagick module settings
     cols: width of image
     rows: height of image
     suffix: Imagick magic file ending such as png, tif, jpg
             The suffix is how Imagick chooses its file output format 
     FIXME: Add more settings and tile settings and ability
     mode:   "degrees" Degree out from center degrees
                 degrees: The degrees out from center point of data
             "full" Use full extent, row cols of data (For example, full LatLonGrid )
-->
  <io names="image" module="librapioimage.so">
    <!--output mode="degree" suffix="png" cols="500" rows="500" degrees="1"-->
    <output mode="full" suffix="png" />
  </io>

<!-- GDAL module
     cols: width of image
     rows: height of image
     suffix: added to the file ending.
     driver: Known GDAL driver string say from https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html 
     FIXME: Add more settings and tile settings and ability
     degrees: Degrees out from datatype center to create a Lat Lon coverage
-->
  <io names="gdal" module="librapiogdal.so">
    <output driver="GTiff" suffix="tif" cols="1000" rows="1000" degrees="10" />
  </io>

<!-- GRIB module
-->
  <io names="grib" module="librapiogrib.so">
    <output />
  </io>
</datatype>
