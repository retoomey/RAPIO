  The whole global vs command line debate...things will evolve hopefully

<settings>

<!-- Settings for the individual datatype reader/writers. 
     Currently these are global for every algorithm
Information needed:
1.  names  == the introduced builder name.  Used in FML records, etc. It's the
    lookup for a record to a reader. Spaces separate alias
2.  Each io can have multiple outputs with different settings, allowing a 
    writer to be called multiple times.  For example writing png and jpeg at 
    same time.
