<!-- Color database for color maps
   Toomey Feb 2022
   A meta file for how to do colormaps.  This is better design than the current WDSS2/MRMS setup
   so I might push this into that code at some point.
   Two types:
     1. Our NSSL W2/MRMS colormaps (type="w2" name="Reflectivity.xml")
     2. Paraview/idl/matplotlib maps
        http://paraview.org/Wiki/Colormaps
        I like playing with these since they have a more traditional 'GIS' colormap style.
        I'm using Paraview format because as of now they still have that going in current versions of linux.
        Currently there are 41 colorsmaps from IDL and 50 colormaps from Matplotlib in idl_colormaps.xml
        In theory you could use Paraview to design new colormaps for data.

<!-- Settings for colormap generation.
     It is good practice to list the product here, but the default for WDSS2 DataType products is to hunt 
     for a WDSS2 color map file using the DataType + ".xml" as an extension.  This closely matches the
     current MRMS way of doing it.  However, since we have this table we can use other types of color maps
     such as generated Matlab style.  We can also override missing and unavailable the 'special' types.

     key:  The lookup name of the colormap.  With WDSS2 products this is the DataType name
           such as "Reflectivity".
     type: Type of colormap (default is w2):
            w2: filename refers to the MRMS color map file. 
            para: filename refers to a Paraview color map file, a collection of names maps.

     filename: The file referenced.
     name: Paraview key
     lowdata: Low value of data for Paraview maps.  This maps to the X -1 range  0% of color key.
     highdata: High value of data for Paraview maps.  This maps to the X +1 range 100%  of color key
     missing: The color override for Constants::MissingData.  Since we use say -99000 or special values
              you will most likely need this with non-WDSS2 file based color maps.  Of course, you
              can also override the file missing here if needed.  The default will be from the WDSS2
              filename if it is using that style.
              The format is '#rrggbb' or '#rrggbbaa' using hex values for colors in html style.
     unavailable:  The color override for Constants::DataUnavailable.  Same as missing above.
