# Test to run the RAPIO build on container rsimplealg example.
# When the container is built correctly this will work when you
# run it.  You can make a copy of this with your algorithm to
# execute it from the HOST directly instead of inside the container.

# You can remove the -t for 'slightly' more speed maybe,
# but lose terminal colors, etc.

# Go set your settings here oR you could put everything in here 
# to make a more portable script
source config.sh

# Run this algorithm.  To run yours do
# /BUILD/MYALGS/Algname/binary
